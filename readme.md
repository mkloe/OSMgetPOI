## Installation
If you are using MacOS, you will need to install brew before installing the OSMgetPOI. You can install it at https://brew.sh/ or run the following line of code in your terminal:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
   
To launch the OSMgetPOI package with Julia v1.7 on Windows, Linux and MacOS: 
1. Clone the repository or download it locally.
2. Launch Julia in the OSMgetPOI directory.
3. Run the following commands in Julia.
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(pwd())
Pkg.build()
using OSMgetPOI
```
Note! Executing the command `Pkg.build()` will trigger downloading of the [OSMfilter](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter).

## Basic information
The project consists of 2 main parts:
- `/src` directory where the source code is located. The source code contains the following key functions:
    - `download_bbbike_file` and `download_geofabrik_file` - they download and unzip .osm files
    - `get_poi_df` - it parses the .osm file from function argument and returns a Julia DataFrame with all the processed POIs. The dataframe may be used for further analysis or easily exported into CSV file.
 - `demo.ipynb` - jupyter notebook which shows how the package works.

#### Proposed POI types and osmfilter queries:

The package supports the POI Types shown the table below. To add your own POITypes, go to `src/POITypes`.
