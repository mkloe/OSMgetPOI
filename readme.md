## Documentation
To run Documenter.jl documentation locally, please open the OSMgetPOI directory and run the following shell commands:
```
cd docs
julia make.jl
julia -e 'using LiveServer; serve(dir="build")'
```
To use the package you will need to install OSM Filter: https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmfilter

## Basic description of the repository
The project consists of 2 main parts:
- `/src` directory where the source code is located. The source code contains the following key functions:
    - `download_bbbike_file` and `download_geofabrik_file` - to download and unzip .osm files
    - `get_poi_df` - it parses the .osm file from function argument and returns a Julia DataFrame with all the processed POIs. The dataframe may be used for further analysis or easily exported into CSV file.
    - other main functions - described in the documentation
 - `demo.ipynb` - jupyter notebooks which show how the package works.

#### Proposed POI types and osmfilter queries:

The package supports the POI Types shown the table below. To add your own POITypes, go to `src/POITypes`.
